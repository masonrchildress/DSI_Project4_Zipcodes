    "\n",
    "The ***objective*** of the client project is to ***use zipcodes to proxy home values and loss in event of disaster***. Our project consists of building a tool to return housing and population metrics in a given zipcode.  The user will feed the code with a comma delimited list of affected areas (zip codes, can be int or str format) as input, and retrieve the current property values.  \n",

    "## Interesting Packages Used\n",
    "---\n",
    "For this project we leveraged the Python packages [folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/) to create our tool and [uszipcode](https://pypi.org/project/uszipcode/) as our source of demographic information. Inputting any number of zipcodes into our tool returns interactive icons at the zipcode's location and displays relevant demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Information\n",
    "---\n",
    "For the home value data, we used the [Zillow Research](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) page to download flat files of ***Median Home Values by Top and Bottom Tiers***.  The tier system in Zillow is divided into thirds given a ***geography*** parameter that allowed us to pull data on the zipcode level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Python package [uszipcode](https://pypi.org/project/uszipcode/) has datasets that returned high level metrics given a zip.  We used that data to create a dataframe that gets passed into the our display tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Data\n",
    "Due to usage of Zillow Research data and the specificity of top and bottom tier information given a zipcode.  The number of zipcodes available to use that had populated values across top, bottom, overall tables were approximately 5k, 2.8k, and 10k respectively.  \n",
